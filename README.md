# SpotifyAnalytics2025

This repository contains the final project for the Visual Analytics course. Our goal was to decode the "science" behind music success by combining data visualization, machine learning, and web development.

The project is structured into three main components:

1. Visual Storytelling (Tableau): An in-depth analysis of global music trends, the evolution of genres, and the impact of streaming on song duration.

2. Music Recommendation Engine: A Machine Learning model (KNN) that recommends songs based on their mathematical "sonic DNA" (audio features like energy, danceability, and acousticness).

3. Interactive Web App (Streamlit): A user-friendly application where anyone can explore the data, visualize genre profiles, and get personalized song recommendations in real-time.
